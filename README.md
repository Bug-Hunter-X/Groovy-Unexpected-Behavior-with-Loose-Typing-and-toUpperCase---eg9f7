# Groovy Unexpected Behavior with Loose Typing and toUpperCase()

This example demonstrates a potential issue in Groovy related to its loose typing system.  When a method expects a String and receives a list instead, the code might compile without errors but lead to unexpected runtime exceptions, specifically when using methods like `toUpperCase()` which are not defined for lists.  The solution provides a type check or robust error handling to avoid such issues.

## Bug Report

The `myMethod` function is designed to handle null or empty strings, and otherwise convert strings to uppercase.  However, if a list is passed, the `toUpperCase()` method call will throw a `java.lang.ClassCastException`.  This is because Groovy's dynamic typing allows the list to be passed without a compile-time error.

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit type checking before attempting to call the `toUpperCase()` method. This prevents the exception by either throwing a meaningful error or performing an alternative action.
